# Multi-Channel Auto-Encoders
This repository contains the code required to build, train and evalute the MCAE and StaNoSA models.

## Requirements
The following will need to be installed manually.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

## Getting Started
Running the code should be as simple as:

`./run.sh`

This will use `mlflow` to start and track the training runs. Expect this to take some time.
